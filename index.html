							<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
							<h3>Introduction</h3>
								<p>This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) explains how SharePass ("SharePass" or "we") collects and processes information from members and users of this website and our software application (collectively "SharePass' products”). SharePass' products include, but are not limited to, the SharePass extension for web browsers (the “Extension”) and the website located at sharepass.github.io (the “Website”). To the extent that SharePass' products have links to other websites, please note that we do not own, operate, or control them, and they have their own controlling privacy policies that you should review.</p>

							<h3>Data we collect and why</h3>
								<p>In order to ensure your data is secure and you have a continually improving user experience, SharePass must collect limited information from you.</p>
							<h4><i>Account</i></h4>
								<p>When you become a member of SharePass, you share a limited amount of information during the registration process, specifically, your username. We authenticate your account and encrypt your sessions using a randomly generated set of keys we assign to your device when you first download the Extension.</p>


							<h4><i>Technical</i></h4>
								<p>SharePass automatically collects some event data to ensure SharePass products are working correctly, to detect and prevent fraud and to identify potential bugs or areas of needed improvement. This includes data like the websites you share, event stamps and error logs. This does NOT include the session data itself, which is a combination of your cookies, session and local storage data that is encrypted end-to-end during transmission over an SSL secured network. <br><br>

									SharePass also collects some general, non-identifying information to ensure that our products meet the standards that our community expects from us. We use common digital tools such as Google Analytics to understand how our users engage with our products so that we can evaluate the community response to bug fixes, new features and updates we roll out periodically.</p>

							<h3>Sharing data</h3>
								<p>We will never sell your data. We’ll only share it with your consent or in ways you’d expect, for example, with businesses who help us operate SharePass, or if we are legally required to do so. We may share information with our service providers (businesses that work for and with us) for the purpose of running SharePass and fulfilling our commitments to you. These include businesses that perform services on our behalf, including to help us maintain our products, provide support for legal, security protection, marketing and customer service. <br><br>

								If you choose to click on an exclusive affiliate link or promotional offer presented on a SharePass product, we may forward that vendor basic information such as your SharePass username so they can gauge your eligibility for the offer. These interactions may result in SharePass being rewarded with an affiliation commission.<br><br>

								We may also share information with your express consent, to third-party companies (but only for purposes allowed by this Privacy Policy), in an aggregate or anonymised format that does not identify any specific person. If required by law, we will share your information for a valid government request, when we believe in good faith that it’s necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, or investigate fraud. Finally, we may also share your information with a buyer or successor if SharePass is involved in a merger, acquisition, or similar corporate transaction. If that happens, you will be notified prior of any change in ownership, as well as any choices you will have as a result.</p>

							<h3>Protecting your data</h3>
								<p>The security of your information is of utmost importance to us which is why we have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards. These measures include limiting access, collecting minimal personal user data, only storing your sessions on your local devices instead of our servers, using encryption, leveraging SSL secured networks, testing for vulnerabilities, employing anonymisation techniques, and more. <br><br>

								Unfortunately, despite our best efforts, we can’t guarantee that user information will not be accessed, viewed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed as a result of a breach of any of our safeguards. You provide us with information at your own risk and agree to taking ultimate responsibility of your data and the accounts your share.</p>

							<h3>SharePass and Sessions (Cookies and Storage)</h3>
								<p>	SharePass uses cookies, local storage and session storage (we'll combine these to "sessions") to enable users to share access to their accounts without sharing their passwords. If you do not consent to the sharing of your session to your intended recipients, you should not install the SharePass Extension as this is how the Extension fundamentally operates. The sessions are encrypted on transmission over an SSL secured network so no unintended users will be able to read your session data; however, your intended recipient will be able to access this information as this is the nature of how internet browsers function, in that they store your session data in plain text for users to read.</p>

							<h3>Managing your Data</h3>
								<p>SharePass does not collect personally identifying data hence we generally do not accept requests to delete profile or historical event data; except on exceptional cases where it is deemed valid to do. You may submit your queries to <a href="mailto:sharepassapp@gmail.com">sharepassapp@gmail.com</a>.

							<h3>General Data Protection Regulation</h3>
								<p> The information that you share and we collect are described in this Privacy Policy. SharePass uses aggregated, anonymised data to improve our products and user experience. SharePass may also collect or process your personal information if we have a legal basis to do so, such as when you consent to our use of your data for a specific purpose; protecting our legal rights or when we need to process your data to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.
									<br><br>
									EU residents have the following rights with regard to their personal data. To exercise any of these rights, please contact us at <a href="mailto:sharepassapp@gmail.com">sharepassapp@gmail.com</a>. Please note that these rights are limited, for example, where fulfilling your request would adversely affect other individuals or our legal obligations.
									<li> Right to Access: You have the right to request information about your personal data, how we use it, and who we share it with.
									<li> Right to Portability: Where you have provided your personal data to us on the basis of your consent, you have the right to ask us for a copy of this data in a structured, machine-readable format and to ask us to send this data to another data controller.
									<li> Right to Rectification: You have the right to ask us to correct your personal data where it is inaccurate or incomplete.
									<li> Right to Erasure: In certain circumstances, you have the right to ask us to delete the personal data we hold about you.
									<li> Right to Withdraw Consent: You may withdraw consent to use your personal data for processing at any time.
									<li> Right to Object to Processing: In situations where we are processing your personal data based on our legitimate interest, you can object that the interest is no longer legitimate. SharePass will stop processing that data, unless we can demonstrate an overriding legitimate ground. You can also request to opt out of direct marketing.
									<li> Right to Restrict Processing: You have the right to ask us to stop any active processing of your personal data while we seek to verify data you claim is inaccurate, while we verify our legitimate interests, or while we cannot erase that data due to legal obligations.
									<li> SharePass will try to respond to these requests within 30 days, but some might take longer. You will typically not be charged any fee for effecting these rights, but SharePass reserves the right to charge a reasonable fee (or refuse to comply) if the request is unfounded, repetitive, or excessive.

									<br><br>Complaints: In the event that you wish to make a complaint about how we process your personal data, please contact us at <a href="mailto:sharepassapp@gmail.com">sharepassapp@gmail.com</a> and we will do our best to resolve it. You can also choose to file a complaint with the relevant data protection authority.</p>

							<h3>Minors</h3>
								<p>We created SharePass for the exclusive use of adults (18 and older). We don’t knowingly collect or solicit personal information from children. If you are a child under 18, please do not attempt to register for SharePass' products or send any personal information to us. If we learn we have collected personal information from someone under 18, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.
